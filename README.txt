IPA Palette is a palette-class input method for OS X 10.3 and later.
It makes possible point-and-click input of International Phonetic
Alphabet symbols into Unicode-savvy applications (i.e., any application
worth using.)

The source code builds two flavors of IPA Palette. The first is the original
Component Manager based version for 10.3-10.4. The second is based on IMKit
and requires 10.5 or later.
